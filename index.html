                <h2>Singer-Songwriter</h2>
            </a>
            <p>Ian Miller is a New York-based singer-songwriter and pianist who draws on funk, gospel and soul stylings
                to tell stories that are candid and hopeful. At times bold and energizing, at times intimate and
                contemplative, Ian’s music speaks to the range of what life brings and how the soul responds. In his
                writing and his performing, Ian is known for his vulnerability and honesty as he explores the joys and
                challenges of becoming who we are.</p>
